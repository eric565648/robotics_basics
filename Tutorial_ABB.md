# ABB Tutorial

This is Eric's tutorial for anyone who wants to use ABB robots at RPI. This tutorial is aimed to be the very first step (a.k.a newbies).

From this point, **you** refers to the newbie (you) wanting to use ABB robots.

## Prepare Your PC

### Install Python-ABB Interface

We will use RPI developed interface. And you can first practice everything in RobotStudio (ABB simulator)

See this repo and install all required python packages

### Setup Visual Studio Code and Python (Windows or Ubuntu)

You are welcome to use either Windows or Ubuntu.

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and we will use it as out main editor. (Please don't use Pyspider)

If you are using Windows, we are going to use PowerShell for python.

Note: If you have problem doing this section, feel free to ask ChatGPT how to do these.
